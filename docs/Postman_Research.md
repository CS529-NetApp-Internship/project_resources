# Postman Research

## Overview
[Postman](https://www.postman.com) is a collaboration platform for API development, teams can easily join the website and work to create, document, and test their APIs. It is a bit more clean in terms of design than Swagger

## Available Features

Quick Rundown:
- Postman has builtâ€”in support for popular data formats such as OpenAPI, GraphQL, and RAML. Also works, though not as well with JSON and YAML.
  - Import a singular API (request) from a YAML or JSON formatted file.
  - Import a Collection using these formats or a link, though errors may arise if not in the exact format Postman expects.
    - Postman Collections are sets of organized API calls!
  - When you import an API or collection from a YAML file you can then add a brief summary with an accompanying more in-depth description of the API (in markdown).
- *Has a "Try it Out" or essentially a test/run the API feature.*
- Can expand/collapse specific blocks of code or requests.
- *Has a search feature.*
- *Offers version control for APIs.*

### Features Missing Currently In Swagger

There are a variety of features that Postman has that Swagger is missing:
- Postman has an online UI for developers to update their APIs easily, without any backend work.
- *Postman has version control for APIs.*
- Has more of a deep search functionality, though I feel it is far from perfect while being better than what is currently offered by Swagger.
- Cleaner design.
- Easy-to-use website UI that allows API developers to update things right on the web.
- Automated testing for APIs.
- Perform a full-system or full-collection test. Run everything, not just specific collection components.

## Pros / Cons
### Pros:

- Free!
- Version control for APIs.
- Better and easier to use API tester/runner.
- Has a form of a search feature.
- All API updates can be performed easily online using the Postman website or App.

### Cons:

- No full-featured Expand or Collapse, can just do it on specific code blocks or request groups, not all entities.
- More support for JSON than YAML files.
- Even when it converts the JSON file for say the Swagger Petstore example to a Postman collection, it does not carry over the descriptions from Swagger. This means that one would have to go back to the Swagger UI and manually add these descriptions for different requests or portions of the project.
- It has a search feature but it is far from a deep search. Using relevant search queries for a multitude of requests, the search query was only able to return one or two that had the word being queried in the title it seems.
