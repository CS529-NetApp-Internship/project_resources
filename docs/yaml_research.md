# YAML Investigation Findings

## Major Takeaways
- The YAML is the file that supplies the data to the [ONTAP REST API](https://library.netapp.com/ecmdocs/ECMLP2856304/html/index.html#/).
- The index.html file is the one that visualizes and organizes the data from the YAML file.
- All of the description tags are written in Markdown.
- The details tags are how the index.html styles what are known as "docs".
