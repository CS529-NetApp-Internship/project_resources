### Features Missing Currently In Swagger

One of the most important aspects of Swagger that do not exist in `readme.io` is
that swagger is open sources. This allows it to be free to use and creates a
community supporting the tool and fixing any known issues.

## Pros / Cons

### Pros

- Compatible with the existing swagger file
- Very easy to use dashboard
  - Dragging and dropping items on the pages
  - Easily create code snippets and examples
- Customizable color pallet, backgrounds, fonts
- Custom CSS and Javascript
- Provides way for users to suggest edits to documentation
- Builtin version tracking and changelog

### Cons

- Many of the appealing features require payment, some of these features are:
  - Custom CSS and Javascript
  - Some site navigation features
  - Including multiple collaborators on the same project
  - Custom domains
  - Custom error pages
  - Internal documentation
  - Health check
- Some reviews of the tool mention that it includes bugs and it lacks support

## Takeaways

`readme.io` is a great and easy way to document an API. The main downsides are
the monetary costs but the benefits are the ease of use and simplicity it
provides. Overall, if NetApp is
willing to pay for the costs of this service, then it would be a great
alternative to Swagger. It's however, worth mentioning that `readme.io` might be
too restrictive in the future and that the cost might increase with time.

### Some features of `readme.io` worth implementing on other platforms

- Vertical pane layout to facilitate reading long documentation
- Dropdown menu in the header instead of horizontal list
